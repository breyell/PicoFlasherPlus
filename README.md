# PicoFlasher Plus

This project is an addon board to make using [PicoFlasher](https://github.com/X360Tools/PicoFlasher) even easier. Connect wires to the pin header and use the switch to go between flashing 4gb and non-4gb systems. Kits will soon be for sale at [Bonzo's Retro Shop](https://bonzosretro.shop).
